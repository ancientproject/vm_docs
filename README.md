### History

Once i read an [article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Creating_a_Virtual_Machine/Register_VM_in_C) about writing custom VM and interpreter bytecode.  
So, i wanted to give it a try. Initially, i planned to write a 4-bit CPU emulator, afterwards i wrote it - but with the development of the source code, bit rate of instructions increased, and emulator has a programming language that is very similar to Assembler language \(and CSS, yeah\).  
It was a wonderful experience, i faced unusual problems and came up with quite unusual solutions.  
Since then, i continued to develop and improve different kinds of features in this project afterwards.  
I do not pursue any goals \(except of course vm speed and language usability\), and i do not expect my VM to be useful - but if you have any ideas on how to improve the project Iâ€™d be happy to hear from you.
